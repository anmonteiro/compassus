## Installation

Leiningen dependency information:

```clojure
[compassus "0.1.0"]
```

Maven dependency information:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>compassus</groupId>
  <artifactId>compassus</artifactId>
  <version>0.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## Guide

To get started, require Compassus somewhere in your project.

```clojure
(ns my-app.core
  (:require [om.next :as om :refer-macros [defui]]
            [compassus.core :as compassus))
```

### Declaring routes

Your application's routes are represented by a map of keywords (the route handlers of your application) to the respective Om Next component classes. The following example shows the routes for a simple application that has 2 routes, `:index` and `:about`:

```clojure
(defui Index
  ...)

(defui About
  ...)

(def routes
  {:index Index
   :about About})
```

To specify the initial route of the application, wrap its component class in a `index-route` call as shown below.

```clojure
(def routes
  ;; :index is the initial route of the application
  {:index (compassus/index-route Index)
   :about About})
```

Routes can also be idents. Below is an example route definition that uses an ident as the route key.

``` clojure
(defui Item
  ...)

(defui ItemList
  ...)

{:items (c/index-route ItemList)
 [:item/by-id 0] Item}
```

### Assembling a Compassus application

Creating a Compassus application is done by calling the `application` function. This function accepts a configuration map that should contain your routes and the options to pass to the Om Next reconciler. Compassus will create the reconciler for you. Here's an example:

``` clojure
(def app
  (compassus/application
    {:routes {:index (compassus/index-route Index)
              :about About}
     :reconciler-opts {:state {}
                       :parser (om/parser {:read read))
```

The configuration map you pass to `compassus.core/application` can also contain an optional `:wrapper` key. This should either be an Om Next component factory or a function that will receive a map with `owner`, `factory` and `props` as argument. It becomes useful to specify a wrapper whenever you want to define common presentation logic for all the routes in an application. Example:

``` clojure
(defui Wrapper
  Object
  (render [this]
    (let [{:keys [owner factory props]} (om/props this)]
      ;; implement common presentation logic for all routes
      ;; call the given factory with props in the end
      (factory props))))

(def wrapper (om/factory Wrapper))

(def app
  (compassus/application
    {:routes ...
     :reconciler-opts ...
     :wrapper wrapper}))
```

#### Implementing the parser

The parser is a required parameter to an Om Next reconciler. As such, a Compassus application also needs to have one, the advantage being that most of the plumbing has been done for you. The parser in a Compassus application will dispatch on the current route. Therefore, all that is required of a parser implementation is that it knows how to handle the routes that your application will transition to. An example is shown below with routes we have previously declared.

``` clojure
;; we declared routes for `:index` and `:about`.
;; our parser should dispatch on those keys:

(defmulti read om/dispatch)

(defmethod read :index
  [env k params]
  {:value ...
   :remote ...})

(defmethod read :about
  [env k params]
  {:value ...
   :remote ...})
```

#### Utility functions

There are a few utility functions in `compassus.core`. Below is a description of these functions along with simple examples of their usage.

##### **`root-class`**

Return the Compassus application's root class.

``` clojure
(compasssus/root-class app)
```

##### **`mount!`**

Mount a compassus application in the DOM.

``` clojure
(compassus/mount! app (js/document.getElementById "app"))
```

##### **`get-reconciler`**

Get the reconciler for the Compassus application.

``` clojure
(compassus/get-reconciler app)
```

##### **`application?`**

Returns true if the argument is a Compassus application.

``` clojure
(compassus/application? app)
;; true
```

##### **`current-route`**

Returns the current application route.

``` clojure
(compassus/current-route app)
```

##### **`compassus-merge`**

By default, Compassus uses Om's `default-merge` function to merge remote responses into the application state. If your server responses are keyed by the current route, use `compassus-merge` as the `:merge` in the reconciler. It will look for the current route in the remote response and merge that into the application state instead.

``` clojure
(c/application
  {:routes ...
   :reconciler-opts {:state ...
                     :parser ...
                     :merge compassus/compassus-merge}})
```

### Changing routes

To change the current route of a Compassus application, call the function `set-route!`. An example follows:

``` clojure
;; the argument to `set-route!` can be one of: a Compassus application, an
;; Om Next component or an Om Next reconciler

(compassus/set-route! app :about)

(compassus/set-route! reconciler :about)

(compassus/set-route! this :about)
```

### Integrating with browser history

URL (or path) navigation is an orthogonal concern to routing in Om Next components, which is mainly about swapping components in and out according to the selected route. However, it might be desirable for applications to setup history navigation only when the application mounts. In addition, applications might also want to teardown history if the application unmounts from the DOM. Thus, the configuration map passed to `compassus.core/application` also accepts a `:history` key which should contain a map with the following keys:

- `:setup` - a function of no arguments that will be called when the application mounts in the DOM.

- `:teardown` - optional. a function of no arguments that will be called when the application unmounts from the DOM.

Below are two examples, one using [Bidi](https://github.com/juxt/bidi) and [Pushy](https://github.com/kibu-australia/pushy), and another using [Secretary](https://github.com/gf3/secretary) and [`goog.History`](http://google.github.io/closure-library/api/class_goog_History.html).

#### Bidi + Pushy example

``` clojure
(ns my-ns
  (:require [om.next :as om :refer-macros [defui]]
            [compassus.core :as compassus]
            [bidi.bidi :as bidi]
            [pushy.core :as pushy]))

(def bidi-routes
  ["/" {""      :index
        "about" :about}])

(declare app)

(def history
  (pushy/pushy #(compassus/set-route! app (:handler %))
    (partial bidi/match-route bidi-routes)))

(def app
  (compassus/application
    {:routes  {:index (compassus/index-route Index)
               :about About}
     :history {:setup    #(pushy/start! history)
               :teardown #(pushy/stop! history)}})
```

#### Secretary + `goog.History` example

``` clojure
(ns my-ns
  (:require [om.next :as om :refer-macros [defui]]
            [compassus.core :as compassus]
            [secretary.core :as secretary]
            [goog.history.EventType :as EventType]
            [goog.events :as evt]])
  (:import goog.History))

(declare app)

(defroute index "/" []
  (compassus/set-route! app :index))

(defroute about "/about" []
  (compassus/set-route! app :about))

(def event-key (atom nil))
(def history
  (History.))

(def app
  (compassus/application
    {:routes  {:index (compassus/index-route Index)
               :about About}
     :history {:setup (fn []
                        (reset! event-key
                          (evt/listen history EventType/NAVIGATE #(secretary/dispatch! (.-token %))))
                        (.setEnabled history true))
               :teardown #(evt/unlistenByKey @event-key)}})
```
